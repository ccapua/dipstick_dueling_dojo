**Da Rulez**
* If you are an egregiously offensive ass (in the opinion of an admin), you will be kicked. You can consider the kick a courtesy warning.
* If you continue being an egregiously offensive ass (in the opinion of an admin, and the admin sees it fitting to ban you), you will be banned.
* Otherwise have fun and try to do the right thing.
